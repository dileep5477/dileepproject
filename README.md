Since 2007, cloud computing appeared as a popular concept, and several businesses started experimenting with its application. Including its flexibility of use, affordability, great scalability, and other benefits, cloud computing enables businesses from the demanding administration and upkeep of their IT infrastructure. As a result of cloud computing, the Internet has become a new computer platform. Most of the business are showing interest towards Cloud Computing because cloud platforms offer some significant benefits such as, speed, cost, scalability, accessibility and better security. As a research Cliquelog IT Solutions is selected for investigating the effectiveness of cloud and non-cloud-based solutions. These assesment will explore the current IT setup of the selected company along with proposing recommendations for service level and other aspects of cloud infrastructure.

# Background of Enterprise:
Cliquelog IT Solutions is a company that offers digital services with over 50+ brilliant employees and few offices in India. 
They began as a website development firm in 2013, created websites, software applications, and extended into a business for the IT industry.

# Current IT Setup:
Cliquelog IT Solutions is a company that has employees from all over the India such, as Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana areas. The company in the current situation is providing their service to 10 cities in all over India. At present Cliquelog employs a cloud system in order to secure data and mutual working. AWS is being used by the company. Having the right cloud partner is important as it affects the funding system. Currently, Cliquelog IT Solutions has employees with a variety of experiences, including.NET Core, Xamarin, and cloud native development using Microsoft Azure or AWS. Additionally, they have a strong Java development team that works on enterprise solutions, public and private cloud hosted applications, web apps, IT solutions, and more. They can also create solutions that run on any OS that supports JVM.
With a variety of JavaScript frameworks and modules, including full stack web products built with Node.js, their developers create native frontend solutions. They also deploy their Node.js development services from full stack Node.js and cloud hosted apps with Azure, GCP, or AWS to responsive web app development to meet customers goals. 
Cliquelog IT Solutions uses the latest operating system of Linux. Linux is extremely flexible and based on a modular design that enables users to modify their own versions of Linux. Depending on the application, Linux may be optimized for multiple goals such as:
•	networking performance, 
•	compute performance, 
•	deployment on some hardware platforms and 
•	deployment on systems with restricted memory, storage, or processing resources.
The organization is using this version right now and there is no security problem has been identified in it. As this organization handles a significant quantity of client’s data, the privacy element is a great problem for them that is why antivirus software is important to put in the operating system. Being informed about those is essential because security and informational elements change daily, and data loss could result from an out-of-date system. Security is the second most crucial element so e very small or medium organization can benefit from taking some steps to increase business security.

# Recommendation: 
The contrast of cloud vs non-cloud:
The location of the program is essentially that makes cloud-based software different from on-premises software(non-cloud). Cloud software is hosted on the user's server and accessed using a web browser, whereas on-premises software is locally installed on the PCs and servers of our company. A selection must consider a variety of factors in addition to accessibility, such as software ownership, cost of ownership, software upgrades, and extra services like support and implementation. The main advantages of Cloud Software are affordable, predictable costa, worry free IT, high levels of security, quick deployment, and scalability but cloud can also have some drawbacks like connectivity, long term costs and less customisable.

# Deployment:
Keeping in mind of security concerns and access of user’s data, cloud computing remains the number one choice for deployment as it was faster and simplified it also has more advantages when compared to non - cloud. Technically Cliquelog company gives many services to clints, so I suggest cloud deployment is best in class for technical operations and a cost saving pay per use model.

# Justification:
I recommend public, private or hybrid cloud deployment for Cliquelog IT Solutions. By seeing above mentioned uses and flows cloud gives better security when compared to non-cloud and allows easy access to resources, user’s data and better cost saving as they only need to pay resources that they use.
